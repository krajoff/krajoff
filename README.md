## üöÄ Project Activities:
**1. Multi-Plane Unit Sensitivity and Balancing Project**
- Authentication & Security: Configured JWT-based Spring Security for registration and authentication, leveraging refresh and access tokens stored as `httpOnly` cookies for enhanced security.
- Database Modeling: Designed a comprehensive PostgreSQL database to manage diverse aggregates, using MapStruct to extract and transform entities into required DTOs.
- Query Optimization: Created complex queries for efficient data retrieval, grouping, and sorting, ensuring performance and accuracy across large datasets.
- API Documentation: Integrated Swagger for API documentation, following RESTful principles in controller development to streamline external integrations.
- Testing: Developed extensive unit and integration tests to validate and verify the interactions between components and ensure robust application behavior.
- Frontend Development: Built a dynamic front end using Thymeleaf and JavaScript for seamless server interaction, enhancing user experience with real-time data manipulation.
- Deployment: Deployed the application on fly.io, providing a scalable and accessible solution for multi-plane balancing: [Balancing App](https://balancing-app.fly.dev).
- **Tech Stack**: Spring Boot, Gradle, Hibernate, PostgreSQL, Docker, Springdoc-openapi, Thymeleaf, Spring Security, Lombok, Liquebase, OpenAPI
